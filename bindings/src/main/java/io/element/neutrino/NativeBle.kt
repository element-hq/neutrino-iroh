 * registered with the native `ndk_context` before any BLE call. Call
 * [initialise] **once at app startup** (with the application context) before
 * invoking `bleSmokeTest` (or, later, any BLE federation path) — UNLESS the host
 * already initialises `ndk_context` for its own Rust layer, in which case the
 * native side self-bootstraps and this call is unnecessary (but harmless).
 *
 * The native symbol (`Java_io_element_neutrino_NativeBle_initialise`) and all of
 * `blew`'s `nativeOn*` hooks live in `libneutrino.so`, so the `System.loadLibrary`
 * below makes every JNI `external fun` resolvable (uniffi loads the same library
 * separately via JNA for its own FFI).
